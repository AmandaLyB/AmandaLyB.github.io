				<summary>BIOMES</summary>
				<div>
					<p>Each biome houses special animals, enemies, and resources. There are 9 biomes: meadows, forest, mountains, plains, swamp, desert, tundra, river, and sea. The biomes have different weather patterns and some will be more dangerous than others. Some producer and companion animals will not work in certain biomes. Land animals cannot cross deep waters.</p>
				</div>

			<details>
				<summary>CYCLES</summary>
				<div>
					<p>The day-night and weather cycles can affect animal, plant, and enemy spawns. There will be less wild fruits and vegetables available during the winter and more skeletons will spawn at night during the colder seasons. Bears will not spawn during the winter. Tamed animals will be slower if they are affected by cold and not wearing any blankets.</p>
				</div>
			</details>
			<h2>TAMEABLE ANIMALS</h2>
			<details>
				<summary>OVERVIEW</summary>
				<div>
					<p>There are four main categories of tamable animals: companions, fighters, producers, and transporters. All of these animals can be tamed by the player when their taming skill reaches the level listed in the table. They can be commanded to follow the player or to stay at home. Companions do not fight and cannot be harmed by enemies, but they can be sent out to gather small amounts of harvestable resources. Fighters can take damage and will attack the target that the player targets, or can be commanded to attack a particular target. Producers will not attack, but can take damage. They must be fed regularly to produce. Transporters are rideable animals that can be equipped with cargo containers. Some transporters can attack.</p>
				</div>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary>COMPANIONS</summary>
				<div>
					<p>Companions can be sent to harvest nearby resources or commanded to follow the player. They do not need a feeding station to harvest, but will harvest at a faster rate if provided with food.</p>
