		</ul>
		<p>Godot is a viable alternative to other game engines for simple, beginner-friendly games in either 2D or 3D. While Unreal Engine excels at creating AAA style 3D games, it is also extremely complicated and better suited to graphically-intense games. Unity is perfect for creating 2D games, but is also more complex than Godot. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of game development by utilizing the excellent tutorials provided by the Godot developers. The techniques learned from Godot will apply to other game engines as well, and provide valuable insight into the game development industry.</p>
		<h2>The Game</h2>
		<p>The idea behind this game is to incorporate my favorite gameplay and UI elements of games that I have played into a well-rounded and fun experience. The gameplay loop will revolve around building, surviving, and taming various animals as found in Valheim, Arc Survival Evolved, VRising in a multiplayer experience with some creative elements found in games like Minecraft.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Intuitive UI</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Menus for building will be concise and fluid</li>
					<li>Pre-defined inventory tabs to separate items logically</li>
					<li>Clothes and armor</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Invetory</>
			<ul>
				<li>Less constrictive weight and space limits for inventory as player progresses (building should be fun, not a chore)</li>
			</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Combat</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Skill-based</li>
					<li>Variety of player skills and combinations</li>
					<li>Variety of enemy skills and combinations</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Taming, breeding, and controlling animals</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Should be fun and rewarding at all stages of gameplay</li>
					<li>Taming food will be intuitive based on animal's natural game environment</li>
					<li>Breeding will create animals with equal or greater stats</li>
					<li>Controlling animals must be simplistic (no giant, multi-level selection wheels)</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Gameplay</li>
