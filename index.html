		<h2>Update 01 - Spawning Block Blueprints with Custom Materials and Meshes</h2>
		
		<p>Blocks are defined using inheritance from a master block blueprint. Blocks are then split based on whether they are interactable (chests, crafting tables, etc.) or not (building blocks). Block materials have been created based on a master material using the same methodology. Using polymorphism, the block material is able to take in one material or many, as is the case with the grass block which uses three materials to define the sides, top, and bottom. Blocks are set to spawn using the 1 through 5 keys on the keyboard. </p>

		<h2>Updated 02 - Serialization, Hotbar, New Materials, and Generating Item Icons</h2>
		
		<p>The game now has a save state using a hash map to store game data inside of a game instance. Variable data will no longer be deleted when exiting play for the specified Level. Additionally, a basic HUD widget has been implemented. The HUD contains a hotbar that allows both mouse wheel selection and numeric selection of the individual slots, a player icon, and a functional health indicator. </p> 
		
		<p>The icons displayed in the hotbar were created using a special Level created specifically for high resolution screenshots of each item added to the game. The orthographic-esque view was attained through reducing the camera's FOV and the scene transparency was achieved through setting the custom depth mask parameter of the block mesh to true. New matierals have also been added to enhance the look of the blocks during development.</p>
