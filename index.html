		<h2>Why Godot?</h2>
		<p>Godot is a viable alternative to other game engines for simple, beginner-friendly games in either 2D or 3D. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of game development by utilizing the excellent tutorials provided by the Godot developers. The techniques learned from Godot will apply to other game engines as well, and provide valuable insight into the game development industry.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open source for personal or commercial use</li>
			<li>User-friendly, simple interface</li>
			<li>Provides well-structured and detailed <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html">learning materials</a></li>
			<li>Allows coding with multiple languages</li>
			<li>Features include networking, multiple rendering methods, and an extensive library of plugins</li>
			<li>Ships to Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, browsers, and consoles</li>
			<li>Supports 3D and 2D environments</li>
		</ul>
		<p>While Unreal Engine excels at creating AAA style 3D games, it is also extremely complicated and better suited to graphically-intense games. Unity is perfect for creating 2D games, but is also more complex than Godot. For these reasons, Godot is the engine of choice for this project.</p>
		<h2>The Game</h2>
		<p>The idea behind this game is to incorporate my favorite gameplay and UI elements of games that I have played into a well-rounded and fun experience. The gameplay loop will revolve around building, surviving, and taming various animals similar to Valheim, Arc Survival Evolved, and VRising in a multiplayer experience with some creative elements found in games like Minecraft.</p>
		<p>The game will be set in a fantasy environment, similar to the Zelda franchise, where the player can collect resources, craft items, and explore everything that the world has to offer. There will be towns to visit, NPCs to discover, and quests to complete for great rewards. Dungeons, bosses, and events will give level-based rare loot. The player can team up with friends in multiplayer with scaling-difficulty or play alone.</p>
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Intuitive UI</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Menus for building will be concise and fluid</li>
					<li>Pre-defined inventory tabs to separate items logically</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Invetory</>
			<ul>
				<li>Less constrictive weight and space limits for inventory as player progresses (building should be fun, not a chore)</li>
			</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Combat</li>
				<ul>
					<li>PvP and PvE, scaling difficulty</li>
					<li>Variety of player skills and combinations</li>
					<li>Variety of enemy skills and combinations</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Taming, breeding, and controlling animals</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Should be fun and rewarding at all stages of gameplay</li>
					<li>Taming food will be intuitive based on animal's natural game environment</li>
					<li>Breeding will create animals with equal or greater stats</li>
					<li>Controlling animals must be simplistic (no giant, multi-level selection wheels)</li>
				</ul>
			<li class="li_heading">Gameplay</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Craft items from resources</li>
					<li>Build vast, functional structures</li>
					<li>Tame creatures for transportation, food, resources, or companionship</li>
					<li>Level up and learn new recipes and skills, increase stats, and access more powerful dungeons</li>
				</ul>
